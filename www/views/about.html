This software is an entire suite, an intelligent machine, built for the only purpose of giving you the opportunity to make the proper decisions when trading the markets.

Between many of its features, it implements theories coming from the field of Quantitative Finance to empower the analysis.</p> <div class="card bg-teal"> <div class="item item-text-wrap"> <ul> <li>¿Tired of spending time reading what others have to say about the market?</li> <li>¿Are you looking for a reliable source of information?</li> <li>¿Do you think you spend too much time gathering information instead of focusing on your trades?</li> <li>¿Are you still not able to capitalize a currency’s strength, because you missed an economic event?</li> <li>¿Do you keep trusting on technical indicators, besides most of the time they fail to tell the truth?</li> </ul> </div> </div> <p>If you answer YES to any of the above questions, then you certainly need this tool.</p> <p>Statistical, historical regression and automated insight analysis is made in order to provide you with the most accurate approach, plus a better detail on what’s happening on the markets.</p><p> </p><p>Candlesticks analysis is one of the many ways to catch up the next move, but it will not help you if you don’t understand what economic events are telling, or where the trend is going. So, this advisor, tool, software (or however you want to call it) will show you a snapshot from both scenarios: candlesticks patterns and trends are lively detected while our custom “event calendar” algorithm will confirm the move, by scoring each currency according to most recent economic events’ results. There is no chance to make a bad move: you can easily understand what’s going on and make a profit, easily.</p><p> </p><p>¿Is it a new signal provider? No, it’s not, by far.
